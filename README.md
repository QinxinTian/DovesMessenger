This is the prototype of the product we are developing throughout the whole semester, later on we will be implementing based on this:
The website is like a "log-in" page, there are "Email address" field and "Password" field which will let users to fill up with.
User can select "Remember me" to remember his/her account log-in information.
There is "Login" Button as well as the "Please Sign Up Here" button which will redirect you to a new page for you to register:
The new page is for registering, there are "Email Address" field, "Full Name"field, "Phone Number" field, "Password" field, and "Confirm Password" field. In the bottom you can choose to "I accept your terms and Conditions". There you go, you can click the "Register" so as to complete the whole registration process.
You can also feel free to switch back to the login page while you click the "I already have an account".
So far if you click on the "Login" button it will just show you a demo.
The demo is just showing you that there are two users sending messages to each other.
