To launch the application click on login.html available in login folder


This is the prototype of the product we are developing.

The application is a website consisting of a "log-in" page. There is a "Email address" and "Password" field followed by a login button which will allow users to login and proceed to the next page where they can chat with other users.
Users can also select "Remember me" to remember his/her account log-in information.

There is also a "Please Sign Up Here" button which redirects to a new page where new users can register themselves:
In the new page there are the "Email Address" field, "Full Name" field, "Phone Number" field, "Password" field, and "Confirm Password" field. After filling out the fields the user needs to go to the bottom of the page where the user has to check "I accept your Terms and Conditions". Then a user can select register which would add the user to the list of users.
Also a user can switch back to the login page by clicking "I already have an account".
